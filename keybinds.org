A lot of stuff is sort of like in vim (because of evil mode) but a lot of stuff is also verry different, so ill have to learn that :(
* Buffers
- create or find a buffer with "C-x b"
- open buffer in a new window: "C-x 4 b"
- select previous, next buffer with "C-x Left or Right"

- list buffers "C-x C-b"

* Projects
- switch project "C-c p"
- project find file: "C-c p f"
- grep over project "C-c p s g"
